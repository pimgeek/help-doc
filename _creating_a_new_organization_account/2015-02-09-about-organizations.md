Organizations are great for businesses and large open-source projects that need multiple owners and administrators, grouped together with teams that determine affinity and repository permissions.

Organizations include:

* [Business plans][4] for private repositories
* 
[Team-based repository access permissions][5]
* Unlimited owners, administrators, and collaborators [using teams][6]
* Owners team access to organization members' [two-factor authentication (2FA) status][7]
