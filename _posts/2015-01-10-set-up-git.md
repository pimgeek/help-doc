**Tips:**

* GitHub has a [Windows][0] client! You can use it without ever touching the command line.
* To learn more about Git, see "[Getting Started - Git Basics][1]" on the [git-scm][2] website.

#### [*][3][Input][4]

Code blocks like those on this page are part of a scripting language called Bash. To use Bash scripts, we need to use an application that
comes with your Mac called Terminal, usually found at /Applications/Utilities. ![Open Terminal](https://github.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/bootcamp_1_mac_terminal.jpg)
was installed with Git called Git Bash. Git Bash can be found in the start menu under "Git".![Open Git Bash](https://github.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/bootcamp_1_win_gitbash.jpg)
comes with Linux called Terminal. ![Open the terminal](https://github.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/bootcamp_1_linux_terminal.jpg)
comes with your OS called the command line.

    echo 'This is input text'
    # This tooltip tells you what's going on.

A line that begins with the dollar sign ($) indicates a line of Bash script you need to type. To enter it, type the text that follows the $, hitting the return key at the end of each line. You can hover your mouse over each line for an explanation of what the script is doing.

#### [*][5]Output

    # This is output text.

A line that does not begin with a $ is output text that is intended to give you information or tell you what to do next. We've colored output text green in these bootcamp tutorials.

#### [*][6]User Specific Input

    echo '_username_'
    # Outputs the text in the quotation marks.

Areas of yellow text represent your own personal info, repos, etc. If it is part of an input ($) line, you should replace it with your own info when you type it. If it is part of output text, it is just for your reference. It will automatically show your own info in TerminalTerminalGit Bashthe command line.

> Good to know: There will be times when you type code, hit return, and all you are given is another prompt. Some actions that you execute in TerminalTerminalGit Bashthe command line don't have any output. Don't worry, if there is ever a problem with your code, TerminalTerminalGit Bashthe command line will let you know.
> 
> For security reasons, TerminalTerminalGit Bashthe command line will not display what you type when entering passwords. Just type your password and hit the return key.

### [*][7]Next steps: Authenticating with GitHub from Git

When you connect to a GitHub repository from Git, you'll need to authenticate with GitHub using either HTTPS or SSH.

#### [*][8]Connecting over HTTPS (recommended)

If you [clone with HTTPS][9], you can [cache your GitHub password in Git][10] using a credential helper.

#### [*][11]Connecting over SSH

If you [clone with SSH][12], you must [generate SSH keys][13] on each computer you use to push or pull from GitHub.

### [*][14]Celebrate

Congratulations, you now have Git and GitHub all set up! What do you want to do next?
