To put your project up on GitHub, you'll need a repository for it to live in. Let's create one!

On GitHub, you can store all kinds of projects in _[repositories][4]_. Personal repositories belong to _user accounts_, so after you've [signed up for GitHub][5], you can create your first repository!

### [*][6]Create a new repository on GitHub

1. ![New repository menu](/assets/images/help/repository/repo-create.png)In the upper-right corner of any page, click , and then click **New repository**.
2. 
![Repository name field](/assets/images/help/repository/create-repository-name.png)Create a short, memorable name for your repository. For example, "hello-world".
3. ![Repository description](/assets/images/help/repository/create-repository-desc.png)Optionally, add a description of your repository. For example, "My first repository on GitHub."
4. Choose between creating a _public_ or _private_ repository.
  * **Public** repositories are a great choice for getting started! They're visible to any user on GitHub, so you can benefit from a collaborative community.
  * ![Public and private repository options](/assets/images/help/repository/create-repository-public-private.png)
**Private** repositories require a little more setup. They're only available to you, the _repository owner_, as well as any _collaborators_ you choose to share with. Private repositories are only available for paid accounts. For more information, see "[What plan should I choose?][7]."
5. ![Initialize with a readme checkbox](/assets/images/help/repository/create-repository-init-readme.png)Select **Initialize this repository with a README**.
6. ![Create repository button](/assets/images/help/repository/create-repository-button.png)Click **Create repository**.

Congratulations! You've successfully created your first repository, and initialized it with a _README_ file.

### [*][8]Commit your first change

A _[commit][9]_ is like a snapshot of all the files in your project at a particular point in time.

When you created your new repository, you initialized it with a _README_ file. _README_ files are a great place to describe your project in more detail, or add some documentation such as how to install or use your project. The contents of your _README_ file are automatically shown on the front page of your repository.

Let's commit a change to the _README_ file.

1. ![Readme file in file list](/assets/images/help/repository/create-commit-open-readme.png)In your repository's list of files, click **_README.md_**.
2. Above the file's content, click .
3. ![New content in file](/assets/images/help/repository/edit-readme-light.png)On the **Edit file** tab
, type some information about yourself.
4. 
![File preview button](/assets/images/help/repository/edit-readme-preview-changes.png)Above the new content, click **Preview changes**.
5. 
![File preview view](/assets/images/help/repository/create-commit-review.png)Review the changes you made to the file. You'll see the new content in green.
6. ![Commit message](/assets/images/help/repository/create-commit-message.png)At the bottom of the page, under "Commit changes," type a short, meaningful _commit message_ that describes the change you made to the file.
7. ![Commit changes button](/assets/images/help/repository/create-commit-commit-changes.png)Click **Commit changes**.
